# Preface {.unnumbered}

Based on the team’s intensive research and training efforts in AI for Arctic Science, we will develop our training curriculum to address three questions: 

(1) What are the “must-know” topics in AI to help trainees that have little computer science and computing knowledge to quickly grasp the essence of AI and “AI thinking”? 
(2) What is the best way to offer training so AI beginners can get hands-on AI experience and prepare for using and developing AI models to solve real-world research problems? and 
(3) How does one best address Arctic science-specific issues (e.g., identification of spatiotemporal autocorrelation and location-awareness) for the effective AI modeling of geophysical phenomena?

The sections presented here potentially fit into a one-week workshop as follows:
