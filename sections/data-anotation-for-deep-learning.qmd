#  Data annotations for deep learning 

## Goal
To provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the importance of training data, methods to obtain it, tools for annotation, and potential data sources.

## Breakdown
1. Introduction to Training Data
    - What is training data and why is it crucial?
    - Differences between labeled and unlabeled data
2. The Importance of Quality Annotations
    - How annotations impact model performance
    - Common challenges: Inconsistent annotations, class imbalance, etc.
    - Strategies to ensure high-quality annotations: Guidelines, multiple annotators, quality checks
3. Methods to Obtain Training Data
    - Creating your own dataset: Pros, cons, and considerations
    - Using pre-existing datasets: Benefits and potential pitfalls
    - Data augmentation: Expanding dataset size and diversity
    - Transfer learning and pre-trained models: Leveraging external knowledge
4. Annotation Tools 
    - Overview of popular annotation tools: Labelbox, VGG Image Annotator (VIA), RectLabel, etc.
    - Features to consider: Collaboration, format export options, automation capabilities
    - Hands-on demo: Annotating a sample image using a chosen tool
5. Data Sources for RTS and Arctic Science (15 minutes)
    - Public datasets relevant to arctic science and RTS
    - Collaborative efforts and data-sharing initiatives in the research community
    - Ethical considerations: lesson 12
6. Q&A and Discussion
    - Encouraging sharing of personal experiences or challenges with data annotation
    - Discussing potential future developments in annotation tools and techniques
