# Intro to neural networks 

## Goal
Gain a high-level understanding of how a NN works. Understand main components of NN input data, layers, weights, targets, loss function, optimizers, train and test sets, ...

## Breakdown
1. Introduction and Overview
    - Brief history of NN
    - Importance and applications in today's world
    - Relevance to Arctic science
2. Basic concepts and terminology
    - Neurons and layers: Input, Hidden, Output
    - Weights and biases
    - Activation functions: Sigmoid, ReLU, etc.
3. How Neural Networks Learn
    - Forward propagation: How input becomes output
    - Cost function: Measuring how "wrong" the network is
    - Backpropagation: Adjusting weights and biases
    - Gradient descent and learning rate
4. Types of Neural Networks
    - MLP
    - CNN 
    - RNN/LSTM
    - Transformer 
4. Training, Validation, and Testing 
    - Splitting data: Why and how
    - Overfitting and underfitting: Concepts and solutions
    - Regularization techniques
5. Real-world Example and Demonstration 
    - Introduce frameworks (PyTorch, Tensorflow)
    - simple/interesting examples
