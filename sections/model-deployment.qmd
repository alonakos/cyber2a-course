# Model deployment

## Goal
To provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the processes, tools, and best practices involved in deploying deep learning models for various applications.

## Breakdown
1. Introduction to Model Deployment 
    - What is model deployment and why is it important?
    - The lifecycle of a machine learning model: From development to deployment
2. Deployment Challenges 
    - Model size and computational constraints
    - Real-time processing requirements
    - Scalability and handling large numbers of requests
3. Model Optimization for Deployment 
    - Quantization: Reducing the precision of the model's weights
    - Pruning: Removing unnecessary weights or neurons
    - Knowledge distillation: Training a smaller model using a larger model's outputs
    - ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange): A platform-neutral format for models
4. Deployment Platforms and Tools 
    - Cloud Platforms: AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform, Azure Machine Learning
    - Edge Deployment: TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch Mobile
    - Containers: Docker, Kubernetes for scalable deployments
    - Serving Frameworks: TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe
5. Monitoring and Maintaining Deployed Models 
    - Importance of monitoring model performance in real-world scenarios
    - Tools for monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, custom logging
    - Continuous learning: Updating the model with new data
    - Versioning: Managing different versions of deployed models
6. Security and Ethical Considerations 
    - Protecting the model from adversarial attacks
    - Ensuring user data privacy and compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR)
    - Ethical considerations: Bias in deployed models, transparency, and accountability
7. Case Study: Real-world Model Deployment
    - Walkthrough of a real-world scenario of deploying a deep learning model
    - Challenges faced, solutions implemented, and results achieved
