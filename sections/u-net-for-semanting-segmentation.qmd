# Deep dive into U-Net for semantic segmentation

## Goal
To provide participants with a deep understanding of the U-Net architecture, its relevance to semantic segmentation tasks, and its application for RTS mapping.

## Breakdown
1. Introduction to Semantic Segmentation
    - Definition and significance of semantic segmentation
    - Differences between classification, object detection, and segmentation
    - Relevance to RTS mapping
2. Overview of U-Net Architecture 
    - Historical context: Why and where was U-Net developed?
    - Key features of U-Net: Symmetry, skip connections, etc.
    - Visual representation of U-Net's architecture
3. Essentials of U-Net Components
    - Contracting path and its role in feature extraction
    - Bottleneck: Capturing the context
    - Expansive path: Localizing features using skip connections
4. Introduction to Other Semantic Segmentation Models
    - FCN (Fully Convolutional Network): The pioneer in end-to-end segmentation
    - SegNet: Architecture with encoder-decoder structure
    - ...
5. Case Study: U-Net for RTS Mapping
    - Walkthrough of a real-world application of U-Net for RTS mapping
    - Visualization of segmentation results on RTS data
