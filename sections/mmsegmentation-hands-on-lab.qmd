# MMSegmentation Hands-on Lab

## Goal
To provide participants with practical experience in setting up, configuring, and running semantic segmentation tasks using the mmSegmentation framework.

## Breakdown
1. Exploring Configurations
    - Navigating the configuration system in mmSegmentation.
    - Modifying a sample config: Setting dataset paths, model type (e.g., U-Net), hyperparameters, etc.
2. Training a Model
    - Launching a training session using a sample configuration.
    - Monitoring training progress: Observing loss values, potential visualizations, etc.
    - Tips: Highlighting the importance of checkpoints and logging.
3. Evaluating the Model
    - Using mmSegmentation tools to evaluate the trained model's performance.
    - Interpreting common metrics for semantic segmentation (e.g., mIoU).
    - Visualizing segmentation results on sample images.
4. Fine-tuning with a Pre-trained Model
    - Loading a pre-trained model from the mmSegmentation model zoo.
    - Fine-tuning it on the RTS data subset or another sample dataset.
    - Observing the benefits of transfer learning in practice.
5. Discussion and Troubleshooting
    - Sharing insights or observations from the exercises.
    - Encouraging participants to discuss their experiences and any modifications they tried.
