# AI for  Everyone: An Introductory Overview

## Goal
This session aims to introduce AI to a non-specialist audience, ensuring that participants from any background can understand these essential concepts. The focus will be on explaining key terminology and the basic principles of machine learning and deep learning. By the end of this session, participants will have a solid foundational knowledge of key AI concepts, enabling them to better appreciate and engage with more advanced topics in the following sessions.

## Key Elements
ML, DL, NN, CNN, datasets and annotations, training and inference, accuracy and validation, supervised learning, etc.

## Outline

### 1. **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (5 minutes)**
   - What is AI?  
     - Definition and core concepts.
     - Brief history and its role in modern research.
   - Key takeaway: 
     – Artificial Intelligence as a tool, that helps you find insight and patterns in data by applying specific types of algorithms.
     – Artificial Intelligence can be useful during not only the data analysis phase of a scientific method but every step from generating a hypothesis to publishing results. (Let's find out how together)


### 2. **AI Types and Techniques (10 minutes)**
