# Introduction to MMSegmentation 

## Goal
To familiarize participants with the mmSegmentation framework, its capabilities, features, and how it can be utilized for semantic segmentation tasks, including RTS mapping.

## Breakdown
1. Why Use a Framework Instead of Building from Scratch?
    - Efficiency: Frameworks provide pre-implemented functions and structures, reducing development time.
    - Reliability: Established frameworks are tested by a broad community, ensuring fewer bugs and issues.
    - Scalability: Frameworks often come with built-in tools for scaling, such as distributed training.
    - Community Support: Access to a community of users for troubleshooting, sharing best practices, and updates.
    - Model Zoo: Availability of pre-trained models and benchmarks, facilitating transfer learning and comparison.
    - Trade-offs: While frameworks offer many advantages, they might come with a learning curve and may not be as flexible as a custom solution for very specific needs.
2. Overview of mmSegmentation
    - What is mmSegmentation and its place within the MM (MMLab) ecosystem
3. Core Components of mmSegmentation 
    - Datasets and Data Loaders: How mmSegmentation handles data
    - Models: Overview of built-in architectures (including U-Net and its variants)
    - Configs: Understanding the configuration system in mmSegmentation
4. Training and Evaluating Models 
    - Setting up a training configuration: Hyperparameters, dataset paths, etc.
    - Launching a training session: Commands and best practices
    - Monitoring training: Losses, metrics, and visualizations
    - Evaluating models: Tools and metrics available within mmSegmentation
5. Fine-tuning and Transfer Learning
    - The importance of transfer learning in semantic segmentation
    - Using pre-trained models from the mmSegmentation model zoo
    - Fine-tuning strategies for domain-specific tasks like RTS mapping
6. Customizing mmSegmentation
    - Adding custom datasets: Preparing data and integrating it into the framework
    - Implementing custom model architectures or modifications
    - Extending functionalities: Plugins, hooks, and more
7. Exploring Other Frameworks for Diverse Applications 
    - Detectron2: Specialized for object detection and instance segmentation.
    - Transformers (by Hugging Face): Tailored for NLP tasks with transformer architectures.
