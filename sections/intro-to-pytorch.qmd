# Intorduction to PyTorch

## Goal
To provide participants with a foundational understanding of PyTorch, its capabilities, and how it can be used to implement neural networks and process data, especially in the context of Retrogressive Thaw Slumps.

## Breakdown
1. Overview of Deep Learning Frameworks
    - Brief mention of popular frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, etc.
    - Why PyTorch? Advantages and use cases
2. PyTorch Basics
    - Tensors: Understanding the basic data structure in PyTorch
    - Operations with tensors: Reshaping, slicing, mathematical operations
    - GPU vs. CPU: How PyTorch utilizes hardware acceleration
3. Data in PyTorch 
    - Dataset and DataLoader: Efficiently loading and batching data
    - Transformations: Augmenting and preprocessing data
    - Connecting the dots: How RTS data can be loaded and preprocessed in PyTorch
4. Model Building in PyTorch (30 minutes)
    - nn.Module: Creating custom neural network architectures
    - Layers in PyTorch: Linear, Conv2D, RNN, etc.
    - Activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, etc.
5. Optimizers, Loss Functions, and Schedulers
    - Loss functions: MSE, CrossEntropy, etc.
    - Optimizers: Adam, SGD, etc.
    - Learning rate schedulers: StepLR, ReduceLROnPlateau, etc.
6. Training, Validation, and Testing Pipeline
    - Forward and backward propagation in PyTorch
    - Model evaluation: Accuracy, loss, and other metrics
    - Overfitting: Early stopping, dropout, and other regularization techniques
    - A simple example: Training, validating, and testing a small neural network on sample data
